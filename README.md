# Dallas Chillout
_The Dallas skyline, police scanners, planetarium, and chillhop music combined._

I created [this page](http://chill.shadow.systems/) to replicate the functionality of http://youarelisteningtolosangeles.com/ for Dallas without the clutter from the site. I also did not want to use SoundCloud for my audio, instead wanting to use the [Chillhop Records](http://chillhoprecords.com/) Chillhop Cafe live stream from YouTube. While I was at it, I thought it would be nice to add in a vizualization-like effect and replace the sky with a planetarium. The sky is updated in real-time using the location of the Reunion Tower as it's GPS location.
